# REDUX IQ
A repository created to test the use of redux with targetted subscribers.

## Installation
Clone the repository and then run `npm install` & `npm install -g gulp`

## Deployment
Run `gulp watch`. This will open the default browser with the sample app. You can now play around with the form and check how the timestamps are/ aren't changing.
